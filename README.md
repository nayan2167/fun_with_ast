# Fun with ASTs
Provides developers with a programmatic tool to change our own code.
This repository contains a library to analyze and manipulate python code using [Abstract Systax Tress](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) manipulation. 

## Using the library
See the [test-fun-with-ast](https://github.com/shairubin/test-fun-with-ast) project for examples of using the fun-with-ast library.


## Why Fun with ASTs
1. The intellectual problem: 
2. it is fun
2. it is a great learning experience 
3. enables smart and complex manipulations 

## How it works
